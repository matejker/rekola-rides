# Rekola rides
In this project I will look at mobility patterns uncovered by Rekola bike-sharing service in Bratislava, describe basic user behaviour within the city boundaries and try to predict the demand for bike-sharing. This project has 4 parts and it is related to my previous project about Bratislava cyclo infrastructure,  [Cyclo Bratislava](https://matejker.github.io/cyklo-bratislava/#/).
